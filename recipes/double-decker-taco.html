    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Put ground beef in a pan over medium heat, and sprinkle 3/4 of taco seasoning over meat. Cook and stir the ground beef, breaking it up as you cook, until it is browned and crumbly, which is about 10 to 15 minutes. Drain the excess grease.</li>
        <li>Mash the refried beans with water in a small saucepan, and sprinkle the rest of the taco seasoning. Heat the beans over low heat until simmering.</li>
        <li>Preheat oven 300 degrees F. Place the hard taco shells on a baking sheet, and warm them in the preheated oven for 3 to 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>To make guacamole, peel, seed, and mash the avocados in a bowl with 1 tablespoon of sour cream, the lime juice, and salt and papper to taste, set aside.</li>
        <li>To build the tacos, spread each flour tortilla with about 2 tablespoons of heated refried beans. Wrap the tortilla gently around a hard tortilla shell. Spread 2 tablespoons of ground beef along bottom of hard shell, and sprinkle 2 tablespoons of shredded cheese on top of meat. Top the cheese with shredded lettuce, a sprinkle of chopped tomato and onion, and a dollop of sour cream and guacamole.</li>
